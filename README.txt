Accidentally forgot about html5 and webgl, so this is completely for CSS...currently.
Work in progress, etc.

Frame system is maybe mostly done; I will be focusing on actually useful functions and whatnot.

To Do:
1) Element CSS transition macro functions.
2) WebGL/HTML5 frame structure.
3) WebGL/HTML5 macro functions.
